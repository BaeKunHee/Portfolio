# Research Statement (Draft)

## 1. Motivation: Why Statistics

I am majoring in statistics with an interest in understanding how data can be used to support reliable decision-making.
During my undergraduate coursework, I learned various statistical methods for data analysis, including exploratory data analysis,
regression, and hypothesis testing. While these methods were mathematically well-defined, I gradually realized that the quality
and structure of data often determine whether such methods can be meaningfully applied.

Rather than being fascinated solely by model performance or numerical results, I became increasingly interested in
why certain analyses fail or lead to misleading conclusions when applied to real-world data.
This curiosity motivated me to look beyond statistical formulas and focus on the nature of data itself.

## 2. Observation: Limitations of Real-World Data

Through coursework and small analysis projects, I observed that real-world data rarely satisfy ideal statistical assumptions.
Issues such as missing values, inconsistent measurement units, ambiguous variable definitions, and hidden data collection mechanisms
often make standard statistical inference difficult.

In several cases, I noticed that analytical results were highly sensitive to preprocessing choices, such as how missing values
or outliers were handled. These experiences led me to question whether statistical conclusions are sometimes determined
before formal analysis begins, simply due to earlier data handling decisions.

## 3. Action: Learning Data Pipelines as a Research Tool

To better understand and address these issues, I began studying data collection and processing workflows.
Rather than treating data engineering as an independent technical goal, I approached it as a tool for supporting
statistical analysis.

I started building data pipelines that explicitly document how raw data are collected, cleaned, transformed,
and structured into analysis-ready datasets. Throughout this process, I focused on preserving statistical properties
such as distributional shape, measurement scale, and unit of analysis.

By designing these pipelines myself, I gained practical insight into how data-generating processes and preprocessing rules
directly affect downstream statistical inference.

## 4. What I Learned: Data Quality and Statistical Validity

These experiences reinforced my belief that statistical analysis cannot be separated from data construction.
Decisions made during data cleaning and transformation—such as deleting observations, imputing missing values,
or aggregating data—implicitly encode assumptions that influence estimation bias and variability.

I also learned that reproducibility and transparency are essential for credible statistical research.
Well-documented pipelines allow researchers to trace analytical results back to specific data-handling choices,
making it easier to assess robustness and validity.

## 5. Emerging Research Interests

Based on these observations, I am particularly interested in research topics that lie at the intersection of
statistical theory and real-world data challenges. My current interests include:

- The impact of data quality and missingness on statistical inference  
- Regression and modeling under imperfect or noisy data  
- The relationship between data preprocessing decisions and inferential validity  

I hope to develop a stronger theoretical foundation to rigorously analyze these issues.

## 6. Future Direction and Graduate Study

I am seeking graduate-level training in statistics to deepen my understanding of probability theory,
statistical inference, and methodological foundations.
My long-term goal is to become a researcher who can design statistically principled analyses
while fully accounting for the complexities of real-world data.

By studying statistics at the graduate level, I aim to connect theoretical rigor with practical data considerations
and contribute to research that produces reliable and interpretable results.
